Walkman lets you record and replay OkHttp network interaction your Android application. This project was based on the great [Betamax](https://github.com/betamaxteam/betamax) library, which was inspired by Ruby's awesome [VCR](https://relishapp.com/vcr/vcr/docs).

## Usage


Walkman is hosted via [Sonatype](https://oss.sonatype.org/) and is intended to be compatible with any Maven-based build tool.

This is still a work in progress. Please check back soon for updates!
